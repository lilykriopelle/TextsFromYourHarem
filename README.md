Objective
=========

Create a simple web application where users can pay to have texts sent to their phones from a particular phone number on a predetermined schedule.

Basic use case I am thinking of is for dudes on dates to alias my twilio phone numbers as female contacts to make themselves appear more popular than they actually are.  This confers the user the advantages of [preselection](http://www.brobible.com/life/article/preselection-can-get-you-laid/)

You might be worried that any woman with even a modicum of intelligence will quickly realize that your 'friends' are fake. After all, if you have so few real friends that my product appeals to you, it's probably because you lack the social skills to initiate or maintain relationships of the platonic and romantic varieties.

To that I say: who cares how smart she is as long as she'll bang you! If you found your way here, you're probably willing to take whatever you can get!

This application will implement:
+   Devise
+   Omniauth (Facebook only at the start because that's what I know)
+   Twilio (to send messages (EMOJIS????))
+   Stripe (for the users to pay for blocks of texts)
