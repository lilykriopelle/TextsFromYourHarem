Objective
=========

Create a simple web application where users can pay to have texts sent to their phones from a particular phone number on a predetermined schedule.

Basic use case I am thinking of is for dudes on dates to alias my twilio phone numbers as female contacts to make themselves appear more popular than they actually are.  This confers the user the advantages of [preselection](http://www.brobible.com/life/article/preselection-can-get-you-laid/)

This application will implement:
+   Devise
+   Omniauth (Facebook only at the start because that's what I know)
+   Twilio (to send messages)
+   Stripe (for the users to pay for blocks of texts)
